# NTT algorithm using CUDA

This is an implementation of discrete fourier transform on an NVIDIA GPU using CUDA cores

A C++ algorithm of NTT function is converted into CUDA language for parallel implementation.
The CUDA implementation takes for loops in the code and processes them parallelly on the CUDA cores
